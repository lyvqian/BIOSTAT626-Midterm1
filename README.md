# BIOSTAT626-Midterm1

## Description
Human Activity Recognition using Wearable Sensor Technology 

* Task 1: Build a binary classifier to classify the activity of each time window into static (including postural transition) and dynamic. 

* Task 2: Build a multi-class classifier to classify walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, lying, and static postural transition.

## Data Files
The training data used to construct and test the classification algorithm is [training_data.txt](/training_data.txt). 

The test data, containing only feature information, for activity prediction is [test_data.txt](/test_data.txt). 

The two datasets above are required for running the code. Detailed information about the two datasets can be found in [data_dictionary.txt](/data_dictionary.txt) and [feature_info.txt](/feature_info.txt).

## Code
All the code used for training and evaluating for the binary classification task is in [Binary_Baseline.Rmd](/Binary_Baseline.Rmd).

The code that generates the final result of the binary classification task is in [Binary_Final.Rmd](/Binary_Final.Rmd).

All the code used for training and evaluating for the multi-class task is in [Multiclass_Baseline.Rmd](/Multiclass_Baseline.Rmd).

The code that generates the final result of the multi-class task is in [Multiclass_Final.Rmd](/Multiclass_Final.Rmd).
